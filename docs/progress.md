# Progress

## Milestone 0 — Setup (2026-10-05)

**Done**
- Repository layout from CLAUDE.md created; docs moved into `docs/`.
- Blank Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite game in `apps/client` showing a "Dojo Ascent" title screen: landscape, fills the screen, respects safe areas, "turn sideways" message in portrait, pauses in the background.
- Set up for Capacitor later (relative paths, `dist` output); Capacitor not yet installed.
- `packages/sim` with Vitest and one passing test (20 ticks per second).
- `docs/decisions.md` and `docs/progress.md` created.

- Cloudflare hosting connected (a Worker project named `dojo-ascent`, set up in `wrangler.jsonc`). The work was copied onto `main` so Cloudflare publishes it.

**Problems Jay reported**
- The Cloudflare Pages steps didn't match his screen: Cloudflare now creates a "Worker" project by default. Fixed by adding `wrangler.jsonc`.
- The first Cloudflare build failed because `main` didn't contain the game yet. Fixed by copying the work onto `main`.

**Confirmed**
- Jay opened the Visit link on his phone, turned it sideways, and saw the "Dojo Ascent" title screen. Milestone 0 is done.

**Next**
- Milestone 1: Movement (start in a fresh session).

## Milestone 1 — Movement (2026-10-06)

**Done**
- One training room (`content/rooms/training-room.json`) with outer walls, pillars, and a long inner wall.
- Movement rules in `packages/sim`: stick movement, tap-to-move with a route around walls, sliding along walls, 20 ticks per second. 13 automated tests pass (never through walls, same inputs always give the same result, saveable state).
- The Phaser game draws the room and a placeholder character (a white circle with a belt and a dot showing which way it faces), with a gold ring where it's walking to and a small walking bob.
- Title screen now says "Tap to start".
- Pushed to the `claude/determined-noether-ikwere` branch for a Cloudflare preview link. Not yet copied onto `main`.

**Waiting on Jay**
- Test on his phone: does moving feel smooth and natural with both tap-to-move and the stick?
- OK to copy the work onto `main` (the live link).

**Next**
- After Jay's OK: copy onto `main`, then milestone 2: Combat core (fresh session).
